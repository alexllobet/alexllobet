ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Alex. I'm an A.I. enthusiast and developer. 

:mortar_board: I studied Telecommunications Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, UPC, in (Barcelona). 

:hammer: Later I worked in the VoIP sector and there was when I made my first contact with A.I., developing a project where I troubleshot communication issues with Deep Learning techniques. Since my knowledge limited the project from perfection, I decided to get an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (MAI), at the very same university. Now I'm working as a Data Scientist in Entrust Corp.  developing a project where I model the company's customers' behavior by applying data mining techniques. 

ðŸŒ± Since deploying was not covered in my MSc, I'm currently studying a Coursera course about Mobile development using React Native, taught by the company  Meta. I'm also studying for the AWS associate certificate, so sooner than later, I'll be able to deploy my models end-to-end outside a company context!

:blue_heart: Meanwhile, I'm doing Kaggle competitions, collaborating on other people's projects, and developing my own project: a Spanish fuel price predictor! I also have a solid interest and understanding of how Bitcoin's and Ethereum's blockchain work, and it is my intention to learn Solidity next year!
